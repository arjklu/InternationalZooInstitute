The following tools and technologies were being used in designing this application:

1. SQL Server Management Studio 2012 has been used as database for storing and accessing the records.
2. Apache Tomcat8.5 server is been used as a servcer for running this application.
3. The application is built and tested in Java JRE1.8 environment.
4. JSF pages have been used as a front end webpage 
5. A final class has been created for maintaining all the constant values. The values present in this file remains constant throughout the application.
6. Servlets has been developed for communicating between JSF pages and Databases. Most of the implementation logics were also written here.
7. GIT has been used as its version control
8. JSON objects were being built inside the Java Servlet (IZIServlet.java) and all the user intered information were stored there. The aim of building JSON object for this application is it can be accessed by any application which is running on any OS platform.
9. The code is written by following J2EE coding standards. 
10. Standard Class comments and Method comments were being incorporated.

Note: The IZI User Guide (IZI_User_Guide.doc) has been provided along this application to guide the user with easy and helpful access throughout the application.
